            <h2>Q1. What are the difference between sessionStorage and localStorage ?</h2>
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created
                once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.while
                data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                assigned to that particular tab.

            <h2>Q2. What is the difference between local and global scope in JavaScript?</h2>
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Scope:</b> in general is about the creation of an *execution context* on that single thread (a
                sandbox of
                sorts), inside which code runs. These contexts (scopes) can be nested. <br><br>

                <b>Global scope:</b> is sort of like the html equivalent for JS. It’s the “root scope” which encloses
                all
                other code / scopes.<br>

                Depending on what JS runtime you use, there may be some differences when global scope is initialized
                e.g. In the browser it creates a “window” object + relative pointer (this), in nodeJS the object is
                called “global” instead, etc.<br><br>

                <b>Local scopes:</b> are nested execution contexts (sandboxes) within the global scope i.e. blocks of
                code
                logically grouped by the parser.

            <h2>Q3. what is event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end. <br><br>
                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.<br><br>
                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.

            <h2>Q4. How I can get 'undefined' in JavaScript?</h2>
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                1. If you want to use a variable without initializing it. <br>
                2. When you call a non-exiting property of an object. <br>
                3. Function that does not return a value but you used for returing value. <br>
                4. If you pass number of argument less than parameter in a function. <br>
                5. If you call a variable outside the scope. <br>
